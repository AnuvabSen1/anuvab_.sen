## About Me

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, advised by Dr. Saibal Mukhopadhyay. My work involves creating new simulation frameworks and design tools for quantum sensors for lower power and precision based applications. Presently, I am working on utilizing controlled feedback-based quantum tomography techniques for accurate quantum state preparation, which can boost the performance of quantum photonic sensors.

Besides, I have also delved into quantum optimization by integrating metaheuristic algorithms with QAOA, benchmarking the results against quantum annealing. These findings were presented at Quantum Information Processing 2024 in Taipei and the Science and Information Conference in London.

In addition, I have published extensively in Quantum Machine Learning, developing innovative QLSTM and Quantum ViT models for applications in healthcare and security. I have also implemented novel quantum based heuristic algorithms to optimize these model parameters. My work has been featured in prominent journals and conferences, including QIP, IGARSS, IJCNN, IJCAI, SSCI, IJCCI, Multimedia Tools and Applications, Studies in Computational Intelligence (Book Chapter), etc.

Looking ahead, my research will focus on hardware-classical hardware co-design for photonic quantum sensors. My objective is to develop precise and energy-efficient sensing methods that leverage the capabilities of emerging quantum technologies. My goal is to apply these skills in a dynamic research environment to solve challenging research problems.
